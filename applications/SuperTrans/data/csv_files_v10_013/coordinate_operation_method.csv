1032,Coordinate Frame rotation (geocentric domain),1,"<<<<<This text is continued from the description of the Position Vector transformation formula>>>>>

Note: These formulas have been transcribed from EPSG Guidance Note #7-2. Users are encouraged to use that document rather than the text which follows as reference because limitations in the transcription will be avoided.

Although being common practice particularly in the European E&P industry, the Position Vector transformation sign convention is not universally accepted.  A variation on this formula is also used, particularly in the USA E&P industry.  That formula is based on the same definition of translation and scale parameters, but a different definition of the rotation parameters.  The associated convention is known as the ""Coordinate Frame rotation"" convention. 
The formula is:

   (Xt)          (  1      +rZ      -rY)    (Xs)     (tX)
   (Yt)  =  M *  ( -rZ       1      +rX)  * (Ys)  +  (tY)
   (Zt)          ( +rY     -rX       1 )    (Zs)     (tZ)

and the parameters are defined as:

(tX, tY, tZ): Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target frame.

(rX, rY, rZ): Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

M: Multiplication factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS) where dS is the scale difference. When dS is expressed in parts per million, M = (1+dS*10^-6). When dS is the scale difference expressed in parts per billion, M = (1+dS*10^-9).

In the absence of rotations the two formulas are identical; the difference is solely in the rotations. The name of the second method reflects this.

Note that the same rotation that is defined as positive in the first method is consequently negative in the second and vice versa.  It is therefore crucial that the convention underlying the definition of the rotation parameters is clearly understood and is communicated when exchanging datum transformation parameters, so that the parameters may be associated with the correct coordinate transformation method (algorithm).","The same example as for the Position Vector transformation (coordinate operation method 1033) can be calculated, however the following transformation parameters have to be applied to achieve the same input and output in terms of coordinate values:

This is a multi-step transformation involving the transformation of a geographic 3D CRS to a compound CRS comprising of a geographic 2D CRS horizontal component and a 1D vertical CRS. It is a requirement of the method that the geographic 2D CRS is the horizontal subset of the geographic 3D CRS. Only the height is affected by this transformation; the geodetic latitude and longitude are not. 

The height involves the application of a geoid height difference interpolated at a point in a ""geoid model"" consisting of grid of latitude and longitude with the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid at each grid node. 

The forward transformation from geographic 3D h to compound ( + H) involves the following sequence of steps:
1) apply a Geographic3D to 2D conversion (method 9659, §4.1.4) to convert the geographic 3D coordinates h to geographic 2D coordinates referenced the interpolation CRS .
2)  use  to interpolate the geoid model for N.
3)  then H = h - N
The compound CRS coordinates ( + H) are from steps 1 and 3.


Reverse transformation from compound ( + H) to geographic 3D h:
1)  Use the horizontal component of the compound CRS () to the interpolate geoid model for N.
2)  h = H + N
3) In theory, convert  to h (using the reverse of method 9659, §4.1.4). Theoretically this is indeterminate and requires an assumption about ellipsoidal height. But here use h from step 2, which is the correct value. In practice, geographic 3D coordinates h are obtained by combining  from step1 with h from step 2. The combination of the coordinate tuples replaces the Geographic2D to 3D conversion.","For coordinate transformation: GDA2020 to GDA2020 + AHD height (1), code 9466:

This method transforms coordinates between a geographic 3D CRS and a compound CRS consisting of separate geographic 2D and vertical CRSs. The transformation is three-dimensional and reversible.

A transformation using this operation method consists of two parts:
a)	The transformation of coordinates from the geographic 3D to or from the geographic 2D CRS;
b)	The transformation of ellipsoidal height to or from gravity-related height.

However, complexities arise if the source 3D and horizontal component of the target compound CRS are based on different geodetic datums. To account for any offset between and non-parallelism of the ellipsoid surfaces, the method is entirely dependent upon a suitable three-dimensional transformation existing between the geographic 3D and geographic 2D CRSs, and this may not always be the case. For this reason the general case is considered to be out of scope here and this method is restricted to circumstances where the source geographic 3D CRS and the target geographic 2D CRS are both based on the same geodetic datum, i.e. the horizontal component of the compound CRS is the two-dimensional subset of the geographic 3D CRS. This geographic 2D CRS is also the CRS used for interpolation of the geoid model file grid.

Forward transformation from geographic 3D to compound
Because of the restriction above, latitude and longitude of the point in the source CRS do not change as a result of the transformation; therefore t = s and t = s, where the subscripts 's' and ‘t’ indicates the coordinates in the source and target CRSs respectively.

The vertical component of the forward transformation is as for the Geographic3D to GravityRelatedHeight (gtx) method, code 9665. The method requires that the ‘Interpolation CRS’ - the horizontal CRS to which the grid containing the geoid heights () are referenced - to be specified. That will be the geographic 2D CRS which is both the horizontal subset of the geographic 3D CRS and the horizontal component of the compound CRS. The unit of measure in which the geoid heights are given is part of the file format definition.

The forward case is straightforward:
	t  =  s
	t  =  s
Then using (, ) for interpolation for the geoid height at the point,
	H  =  h  –  

This method transforms coordinates between a geographic 3D CRS and a compound CRS consisting of separate geographic 2D and vertical CRSs. The transformation is three-dimensional and reversible.

A transformation using this operation method consists of two parts:
a)	The transformation of coordinates from the geographic 3D to or from the geographic 2D CRS;
b)	The transformation of ellipsoidal height to or from gravity-related height.

However, complexities arise if the source 3D and horizontal component of the target compound CRS are based on different geodetic datums. To account for any offset between and non-parallelism of the ellipsoid surfaces, the method is entirely dependent upon a suitable three-dimensional transformation existing between the geographic 3D and geographic 2D CRSs, and this may not always be the case. For this reason the general case is considered to be out of scope here and this method is restricted to circumstances where the source geographic 3D CRS and the target geographic 2D CRS are both based on the same geodetic datum, i.e. the horizontal component of the compound CRS is the two-dimensional subset of the geographic 3D CRS. This geographic 2D CRS is also the CRS used for interpolation of the geoid model file grid.

Forward transformation from geographic 3D to compound
Because of the restriction above, latitude and longitude of the point in the source CRS do not change as a result of the transformation; therefore t = s and t = s, where the subscripts 's' and ‘t’ indicates the coordinates in the source and target CRSs respectively.

To account for any offset between and non-parallelism of the ellipsoid surfaces, the method is entirely dependent upon a suitable three-dimensional transformation existing between the geographic 3D and geographic 2D CRSs, and this may not always be the case. For this reason the general case is considered to be out of scope here and this method is restricted to circumstances where the source geographic 3D CRS and the target geographic 2D CRS are both based on the same geodetic datum, i.e. the horizontal component of the compound CRS is the two-dimensional subset of the geographic 3D CRS. This geographic 2D CRS is also the CRS used for interpolation of the geoid model file grid.

Forward transformation from geographic 3D to compound
Because of the restriction above, latitude and longitude of the point in the source CRS do not change as a result of the transformation; therefore t = s and t = s, where the subscripts 's' and ‘t’ indicates the coordinates in the source and target CRSs respectively.

The vertical component of the forward transformation is as for the Geographic3D to GravityRelatedHeight (gtx) method, code 9665. The method requires that the ‘Interpolation CRS’ - the horizontal CRS to which the grid containing the geoid heights () are referenced - to be specified. That will be the geographic 2D CRS which is both the horizontal subset of the geographic 3D CRS and the horizontal component of the compound CRS. The unit of measure in which the geoid heights are given is part of the file format definition.

The forward case is straightforward:

General case.

The geometric representation of the affine transformation is:
XT = XT0   +  XS * k * MX * cos qX   +  YS * k * MY * sin qY
YT = YT0  –  XS * k * MX *  sin qX   +  YS * k * MY * cos qY 
where:

XT0 ,YT0  = the coordinates of the origin point of the source coordinate reference system, expressed in the target coordinate reference system;
MX , MY  = the length of one unit of the source axis, expressed in units of the target axis, for the first and second source and target axis pairs respectively;
qX , qY   = the angles about which the source coordinate reference system axes XS and YS must be rotated to coincide with the target coordinate reference system axes XT and YT respectively (counter-clockwise being positive).
k = point scale factor of the target coordinate reference system in a chosen reference point;
 
Comparing the algebraic representation with the parameters of the parameteric form (code 9624) it can be seen that the parametric and geometric forms of the affine transformation are related as follows:
A0  =  XT0
A1  = k * MX * cos qX  
A2  = k * MY * sin qY
B0  =  YT0
B1  =   – k * MX * sin qX
B2  =   k *MY * cos qY

Reversibility
For the Affine Geometric Transformation, the reverse operation can be described by a different formula, as shown below, in which the same parameter values as the forward transformation may be used:

XS = [( XT  – XT0) . cos qY  –  (YT – YT0) . sin qY ] / [k * MX  * cos (qX – qY)]
YS = [(XT   – XT0) . sin qX   +  (YT – YT0) . cos qX ] / [k * MY * cos (qX – qY)]


Orthogonal case

If the source coordinate reference system happens to have orthogonal axes, that is both axes are rotated through the same angle to bring them into the direction of the orthogonal target coordinate reference system axes, i.e. qX = qY = q, then the Affine Geometric Transformation can be simplified to:

XT = XT0   +   XS .  k . MX . cos q   +   YS .  k .  MY  . sin q
YT = YT0   –   XS .  k .  MX . sin q    +   YS .  k .  MY  . cos q

where:
q  = the angle through which the source coordinate reference system axes must be rotated to coincide with the target coordinate refderence system axes (counter-clockwise is positive). Alternatively, the bearing (clockwise positive) of the source coordinate reference system Y-axis measured relative to target coordinate reference system north.

The reverse formulas of the general case can also be simplified by replacing qX and qY with q:

XS = [(XT  – XTO) * cos q   –  (YT – YTO) * sin q ] / [k * MX ]
YS = [(XT   – XTO) * sin q   +  (YT – YTO) * cos q] / [k * MY ]

In the EPSG dataset this orthogonal case (code 9622) has been deprecated. The formulas for the general case should be used, inserting q for both qX  and qY. The case has been documented here as part of the progression through increasing constraints on the degrees of freedom between the general case and the Similarity Transformation.",(none),NaN,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,26-8-2005,2004.670,0

Reversibility
The reverse transformation is another affine transformation using the same formulas but with different parameter values.  The reverse parameter values, indicated by a prime (’), can be calculated from those of the forward transformation as follows:

D    = A1 * B2   –   A2 * B1
A0’ = (A2 * B0   –   B2 * A0) / D
B0’ = (B1 * A0   –   A1 * B0) / D
A1’ = +B2 / D
A2’ = – A2 / D
B1’ = – B1 / D
B2’ = +A1 / D

The geoid model should be available as a regular grid of latitude and longitude with the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid at each grid node.

The transformation involves the following sequence of steps:
·  Selection of a subset of the geoid file covering the extent of the points to be transformed.
·  If the geoid file is not based on the source or target CRS, it needs to be transformed first. This involves transformation of the chosen subset of the geoid file from its orignal Geographic 3D CRS to the Geographic 3D CRS that is the source or the target of this transformation.
·  Calculation of the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid (""geoid undulation"") at the relevant point(s). This is achieved through a bi-linear interpolation of the geoid undulation, using the latitude and longitude to locate the point in the sub-grid.  This step results in the height of the geoid above the ellipsoid (N) of the Geographic 3D CRS, whether source or target.

The relationship between two projected coordinate reference systems may be approximated more elegantly by a single polynomial regression formula written in terms of complex numbers. The advantage is that the dependence between the ‘A’ and ‘B’ coefficients (for U and V) is taken into account in the formula, resulting in fewer coefficients for the same order polynomial. A third-order polynomial in complex numbers is used in Belgium.

Note that the zero order coefficients of the general polynomial, A0 and B0, have apparently disappeared.  In reality they are absorbed by the different coordinates of the source and of the target evaluation point, which in this case, are numerically very different because of the use of two different projected coordinate reference systems for source and target.

The relationship between two projected coordinate reference systems may be approximated more elegantly by a single polynomial regression formula written in terms of complex numbers. The advantage is that the dependence between the ‘A’ and ‘B’ coefficients (for U and V) is taken into account in the formula, resulting in fewer coefficients for the same order polynomial. A fourth-order polynomial in complex numbers is used in The Netherlands for transforming coordinates referenced to the Amersfoort / RD system to and from ED50 / UTM.

mT.(dX + i. dY) = (A1 + i. A2).(U + i.V) + (A3 + i. A4).(U + i.V)^2 + (A5 + i. A6).(U + i.V)^3 + (A7 + i.A8).(U + i.V)^4

where U = mS.(XS - XS0)
           V = mS.(YS - YS0)
and mS, mT are the scaling factors for the coordinate differences in the source and target coordinate reference systems.

The polynomial to degree 4 can alternatively be expressed in matrix form.

Then
XT  = XS - XS0 + XT0 + dX
YT  = YS - YS0 + YT0 + dY

where
XT , YT      are coordinates in the target coordinate reference system,
XS , YS      are coordinates in the source coordinate reference system,
XS0 , YS0   are coordinates of the evaluation point in the source coordinate reference system,
XT0 , YT0   are coordinates of the evaluation point in the target coordinate reference system.

Note that the zero order coefficients of the general polynomial, A0 and B0, have apparently disappeared.  In reality they are absorbed by the different coordinates of the source and of the target evaluation point, which in this case, are numerically very different because of the use of two different projected coordinate reference systems for source and target.

The transformation parameter values (the coefficients) are not reversible.  For the reverse transformation a different set of parameter values are required, used within the same formulas as the forward direction.","For transformation RD / Netherlands New to ED50 / UTM zone 31N,

The forward case is trivial. A 3-dimensional geographic coordinate reference system comprising of geodetic latitude, geodetic longitude and ellipsoidal height is converted to its 2-dimensional subset by the simple expedient of dropping the height. The axis order change operates on coordinates of a point whose order change is described by the following matrix operation:

[Derived CRS 1st coordinate]   [1  0  0]   [Base CRS 1st coordinate]
[Derived CRS 2nd coordinate] = [0  1  0] * [Base CRS 2nd coordinate]
[Derived CRS 3rd coordinate]   [0  0  0]   [Base CRS 3rd coordinate]


The reverse conversion, from 2D to 3D, is indeterminate. It is however a requirement when a geographic 2D coordinate reference system is to be transformed using a geocentric method which is 3-dimensional. In practice an artificial ellipsoidal height is created and appended to the geographic 2D coordinate reference system to create a geographic 3D coordinate reference system referenced to the same geodetic datum. The assumed ellipsoidal height is usually either set to the gravity-related height of a position in a compound coordinate reference system, or set to zero. As long as the height chosen is within a few kilometres of sea level, no error will be induced into the horizontal position resulting from the later geocentric transformation; the vertical coordinate will however be meaningless.",(none),This is a parameter-less conversion.,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,22-5-2015,2015.018,0

The formulas to convert geodetic latitude and longitude (lat, lon) to Easting and Northing are:

m = cos(lat) / (1 – e^2 sin^2(lat))^0.5

If latO is not negative
lon = lonO + rho {atan2[X , (a . mO / sin(latO) – Y)]} / a . m

lon = lonO + rho {atan2[–X , –(a . mO , sin(latO) – Y)]} / a . m

R is the radius of the sphere and will normally be one of the CRS parameters.

Note however that if applying spherical formula to ellipsoidal coordinates, the projection properties are not preserved.

The transformation between source and target CRS geocentric coordinates is usually described as a simplified 7-parameter Helmert transformation, expressed in matrix form with 7 parameters, in what is known as the ""Bursa-Wolf"" formula:

   (Xt)          (  1      -rZ     +rY)     (Xs)    (tX)
   (Yt)  =  M *  ( +rZ      1      -rX)  *  (Ys)  + (tY)
   (Zt)          ( -rY     +rX      1 )     (Zs)    (tZ)

The parameters are commonly referred to defining the transformation ""from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system"" in which (Xs, Ys, Zs) are the coordinates of the point in the source geocentric coordinate reference system and (Xt, Yt, Zt) are the coordinates of the point in the target geocentric coordinate reference system.  But that does not define the parameters uniquely; neither is the definition of the parameters implied in the formula, as is often believed.  However, the following definition, which is consistent with the 'Position Vector Transformation' convention is common E&P survey practice, 

(tX, tY, tZ): Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source system to target system; also: the coordinates of the origin of the source coordinate reference system in the target coordinate reference system.

(rX, rY, rZ): Rotations to be applied to the point's vector.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the position vector when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis; e.g. a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source system to target system will result in a larger longitude value for the point in the target system.  Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

M: Multiplication factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS) where dS is the scale difference. When dS is expressed in parts per million, M = (1+dS*10^-6). When dS is the scale difference expressed in parts per billion, M = (1+dS*10^-9).

To eliminate high correlation between the translations and rotations in the derivation of parameter values for the Helmert transformation methods (coordinate operation method codes 1032 and 1033), instead of the rotations being derived about the geocentric coordinate reference system origin they may be derived at a location within the points used in the determination.

(rX, rY, rZ): Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system in the positive direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

(Xp, Yp, Zp): Coordinates of the point about which the coordinate reference frame is rotated, given in the source Cartesian coordinate reference system. 

M: Multiplication factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS) where dS is the scale difference. When dS is expressed in parts per million, M = (1+dS*10^-6). When dS is the scale difference expressed in parts per billion, M = (1+dS*10^-9).

Reversibility.
The Molodensky-Badekas transformation in a strict mathematical sense is not reversible, i.e. in principle the same parameter values cannot be used to execute the reverse transformation. This is because the evaluation point coordinates are in the forward direction source coordinate reference system and the rotations have been derived about this point. They should not be applied about the point having the same coordinate values in the target coordinate reference system, as is required for the reverse transformation. However, in practical application there are exceptions when applied to the approximation of small differences between the geometry of a set of points in two different coordinate reference systems. The typical vector difference in coordinate values is in the order of 6*10^1 to 6*10^2 metres, whereas the evaluation point on or near the surface of the earth is 6.3*10^6 metres from the origin of the coordinate systems at the Earth's centre. This difference of four or five orders of magnitude allows the transformation in practice to be considered reversible. Note that in the reverse transformation, only the signs of the translations and rotation parameter values are reversed; the coordinates of the evaluation point remain unchanged.","Input point:

Note that the formula for lat requires iteration. First calculate t' and then a trial value for lat* using 
lat = /2-2atan(t'). Then use the full equation for lat substituting the trial  value into the right hand side of the equation. Thus derive a new value for lat.

(Yt) = M' * ( +rZ'    1    -rX') * (Ys) + (tY')

where 
tX' = tX + dtX (t – t0)
tY' = tY + dtY (t – t0)
tZ' = tZ + dtZ (t – t0)
rX' = rX + drX (t – t0)

(tX', tY', tZ'): Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source system to target system; also: the coordinates of the origin of the source coordinate reference system in the target coordinate reference system.

(rX', rY', rZ'): Rotations to be applied to the point's vector.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the position vector when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis; e.g. a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source system to target system will result in a larger longitude value for the point in the target system.

dS = +0.00971 ppm
ddS = +0.000109 ppm/yr
t0 = 1994.00 
				
First calculate the correction due to rate of change to each of the 7 transformation parameters for the period (t-t0), taking care to convert the translations to the same units as the source CRS (in this case metres) and the rotations to radians:
tX' = –84.68 + [+1.42 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = –56.42 mm = –0.056 m
tY' = –19.42 + [+1.34 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +7.25 mm = +0.007 m
tZ' = +32.01 + [+0.90 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +49.92 mm = +0.050 m
rX' = 0.4254 + [–1.5461 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = –30.34 msec = –1.471021E-07 rad
rY' = –2.2578 + [–1.1820 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = –25.78 msec = –1.249830E-07 rad
rZ' = –2.4015 + [–1.1551 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = –25.39 msec = –1.230844E-07 rad
dS' = +0.00971 + [+0.000109 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +0.01188 ppm

Then M' = 1.00000001188

Using these parameter values, application of the 7 parameter Position Vector transformation to the given (source) ITRF2008 coordinates results in:
Xt = -3789470.004m
Yt =  4841770.686 m
Zt = -1690895.108 m
on the GDA94 (target) geocentric coordinate reference system.

For the reverse transformation from GDA94 coordinates to ITRF08 coordinates at epoch 2013.90, the signs of all parameters need to be reversed except for the reference epoch. Then:
tX' = +84.68 + [(–1.42 * (2013.90 –1994.00)] = +56.42 mm = +0.056 m 
and similarly for the other six parameters. Hence tY' = –0.007 m, tZ' = –0.050 m, rX' = 1.471021E-07 rad, rY' = 1.249830E-07 rad, rZ' = 1.230844E-07 rad and dS' = –0.01188 ppm.

Using these time-adjusted parameters values, M' = 0.99999998812 and then applying the 7 parameter Position Vector transformation fomula to the GDA94 coordinates of 
Xs = –3789470.004 m
Ys = 4841770.686 m

The transformation between source and target CRS geocentric coordinates is a two-step process. The first step is to compute the values of seven Helmert transformation parameters at the required epoch. The second step is to apply a seven-parameter Helmert transformation to the source CRS coordinates. This Coordinate Frame rotation is expressed in matrix form as:

(Xt)        (  1     +rZ'  -rY')     (Xs)    (tX')
(Yt) = M' * ( -rZ'    1    +rX')  *  (Ys)  + (tY')
(Zt)        ( +rY'  -rX'     1 )     (Zs)    (tZ')

where 
tX' = tX + dtX (t – t0)
tY' = tY + dtY (t – t0)
tZ' = tZ + dtZ (t – t0)
rX' = rX + drX (t – t0)
rY' = rY + drY (t – t0)
rZ' = rZ + drZ (t – t0)
dS' = dS + ddS (t – t0)
M' = 1 + dS'

and the parameters are defined as: 
(tX', tY', tZ'): Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector
in the source coordinate reference system in order to transform from source
coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the
coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target
frame.

(rX', rY', rZ'): Rotations to be applied to the coordinate reference frame.
The sign convention is such that a positive rotation of the frame about an
axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the coordinate reference frame when
viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive
direction of that axis, that is a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from
source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system will
result in a smaller longitude value for the point in the target coordinate reference
system. Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure,
the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.


M': The time-adjusted scale correction to be made to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to obtain the correct scale in the target coordinate reference system. M' = (1 + dS'). When the time-adjusted scale difference dS' is expressed in parts per million, M' = (1 + dS'*10^-6). When the time-adjusted scale difference dS' is expressed in parts per billion, M' = (1 + dS'*10^-9).","Transformation from ITRF2008 to GDA94 at epoch 2013.90.

dS = +0.00971 ppm
ddS = +0.000109 ppm/yr
t0 = 1994.00				

First apply the correction due to rate of change to each of the 7 transformation parameters for the period (t-t0), taking care to convert the translations to the same units as the source CRS (in this case metres) and the rotations to radians:
tX' = –84.68 + [+1.42 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = –56.42 mm = –0.056m
tY' = –19.42 + [+1.34 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +7.25 mm = +0.007 m
tZ' = +32.01 + [+0.90 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = 49.92 mm = +0.050 m
rX' = –0.4254 + [(+1.5461 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +30.3420 msec =  +1.471021E-07rad
rY' = +2.2578 + [(1.1820 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +25.7796 msec = +1.249830E-07 rad
rZ' = +2.4015 + [(1.1551 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +25.3880 msec = +1.230844E-07 rad
dS' = +0.00971 + [+0.000109 * (2013.90-1994.00)] = +0.01188 ppm

Then M' = 1.00000001188

Using these time-adjusted parameter values, application of the 7 parameter Coordinate Frame rotation formula to the given (source) ITRF2008 coordinates results in:
Xt = –3789470.004 m
Yt =  4841770.686 m
Zt = –1690895.108 m
on the GDA94 (target) geocentric coordinate reference system.

For the reverse transformation from GDA94 coordinates to ITRF08 coordinates at epoch 2013.9, the signs of all parameters need to be reversed except for the reference epoch. Then:
tX' = +84.68 + [(–1.42 * (2013.90 –1994.00)] = +56.42 mm = +0.056 m 
and similarly for the other six parameters. Hence tY' = –0.007 m, tZ' = –0.050 m, rX' = –1.471021E-07 rad, rY' = –1.249830E-07 rad, rZ' = –1.230844E-07 rad and dS' = –0.01188 ppm.

Xs = –3789470.004 m

To eliminate high correlation between the translations and rotations in the derivation of parameter values for the Helmert transformation methods (coordinate operation method codes 1032 and 1033), instead of the rotations being derived about the geocentric coordinate reference system origin they may be derived at a location within the points used in the determination. Three additional parameters, the coordinates of the rotation point, are then required. The formula is:

   (Xt)          (  1      -rZ     +rY)     (Xs - Xp)     (Xp)     (tX)
   (Yt)  =  M *  ( +rZ      1      -rX)  *  (Ys - Yp)  +  (Yp)  +  (tY)
   (Zt)          ( -rY     +rX      1 )     (Zs - Zp)     (Zp)     (tZ)

and the parameters are defined as:

(tX, tY, tZ): Translation vector, to be added to the point's position vector in the source coordinate system in order to transform from source coordinate reference system to target coordinate reference system; also: the coordinates of the origin of source coordinate reference system in the target frame.

(rX, rY, rZ): Rotations to be applied to the point's vector.  The sign convention is such that a positive rotation about an axis is defined as a clockwise rotation of the position vector when viewed from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate reference system in the positive direction of that axis; e.g. a positive rotation about the Z-axis only from source system to target system will result in a larger longitude value for the point in the target system.  Although rotation angles may be quoted in any angular unit of measure, the formula as given here requires the angles to be provided in radians.

(Xp, Yp, Zp): Coordinates of the point about which the coordinate reference frame is rotated, given in the source Cartesian coordinate reference system. 

M: Multiplication factor to be applied to the position vector in the source coordinate reference system in order to obtain the correct scale of the target coordinate reference system. M = (1+dS) where dS is the scale difference. When dS is expressed in parts per million, M = (1+dS*10^-6). When dS is the scale difference expressed in parts per billion, M = (1+dS*10^-9).

Reversibility.
The Molodensky-Badekas (PV) transformation in a strict mathematical sense is not reversible, i.e. in principle the same parameter values cannot be used to execute the reverse transformation. This is because the evaluation point coordinates are in the forward direction source coordinate reference system and the rotations have been derived about this point. They should not be applied about the point having the same coordinate values in the target coordinate reference system, as is required for the reverse transformation. However, in practical application there are exceptions when applied to the approximation of small differences between the geometry of a set of points in two different coordinate reference systems. The typical vector difference in coordinate values is in the order of 6*10^1 to 6*10^2 metres, whereas the evaluation point on or near the surface of the earth is 6.3*10^6 metres from the origin of the coordinate systems at the Earth's centre. This difference of four or five orders of magnitude allows the transformation in practice to be considered reversible. Note that in the reverse transformation, only the signs of the translations and rotation parameter values are reversed; the coordinates of the evaluation point remain unchanged.",Input point:

The time-specific ooordinate transformation is an alternative approach to the time-dependent coordinate transformation. In this method the transformation parameter values are declared for a specified transformation reference epoch (an additional parameter for the transformation) and coordinates are adjusted to this epoch before the transformation is applied.

A vertical offset allows calculation of coordinates in the target vertical coordinate reference system by adding a correction parameter A to the coordinate values of the point in the source system:
X2 = X1 + A1>2
where
X2 = value in the forward target vertical coordinate reference system.
X1 = value in the forward source vertical coordinate reference system.
A1>2 is the offset to be applied for the transformation from CRS 1 to CRS 2. Its value for the forward calculation is the value of the origin of the source CRS 1 in the target CRS 2.

For the reverse transformation from CRS 2 to CRS 1 the same formula is used but with the sign of the offset A1>2 reversed:
	X1 = X2 + (–A1>2)

The above formulas apply only when the positive direction of the axis of the source and target CRS is the same and where the two vertical CRSs share the same unit of measure. If either of these are to be changed then a concatenated operation including one or more conversions through intermediate vertical CRSs is required. See Height-depth reversal (code 1068) and Change of vertical axis unit (code 1069) for the required conversion methods.","For coordinate transformation: Baltic height to Black Sea height (1), code 5447:

Consider a point having a gravity-related height in the Baltic height system of 2.55m. Its value in the Black Sea height system is
2.55m  + 0.4m = 2.95m.

For the reverse calculation to transform the Black Sea height of 2.95m to Baltic height:
H(Baltic) =  2.95m + (–(0.4m)) =  2.55m.",This transformation allows calculation of height (or depth) in the target system by adding the parameter value to the height (or depth)-value of the point in the source system.,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,16-10-2017,1999.790 2008.010 2014.027,0
9621,Similarity transformation,1,"Note: These formulas have been transcribed from EPSG Guidance Note #7-2. Users are encouraged to use that document rather than the text which follows as reference because limitations in the transcription will be avoided.

The similarity transformation in algebraic form is:

XT = XT0  + XS * M * cos q  + YS * M * sin q
YT = YT0  – XS * M * sin q  + YS * M * cos q

where:
XT0 , YT0    =   the coordinates of the origin point of the source coordinate reference system expressed in the target coordinate reference system;
M                 =  the length of one unit in the source coordinate reference system expressed in units of the target coordinate reference system;
q                  = the angle about which the axes of the source coordinate reference system need to be rotated to coincide with the axes of the target coordinate reference system, counter-clockwise being positive. Alternatively, the bearing of the source coordinate reference system Y-axis measured relative to target coordinate reference system north.

The similarity transformation can also be described as a special case of the parametric affine transformation where coefficients A1 = B2  and  A2 =  - B1.

Reversibility
The reverse formula for the Similarity Transformation is:

XS = [(XT  – XTO) * cos q   –  (YT – YTO) * sin q ] / [M ]
YS = [(XT   – XTO) * sin q   +  (YT – YTO) * cos q] / [M ]

An alternative approach for the reverse operation is to use the same formula as for the forward computation but with different parameter values:
	XT = XTO'  + XS * M' * cos theta'  + YS * M' * sin theta'
	YT = YTO'  –  XS * M' * sin theta' + YS * M' * cos theta'

The reverse parameter values, indicated by a prime ('), can be calculated from those of the forward operation as follows:
XTO' =  (YTO sin theta –  XTO cos theta) / M
YTO' =  –(YTO cos theta +  XTO sin theta) / M
M'   =  1/M
theta'    =  –theta","ED50 / UTM zone 31N to ETRS89 / UTM zone 31N

Parameters of the Similarity Transformation:
XTO   = -129.549 metres
YTO   = -208.185 metres
M     = 1.00000155
theta = 1.56504"" = 0.000007588 rad

Forward computation for source coordinates 300000m E, 4500000m N:

E(ETRS89) = –129.549 + 300000.465 + 34.144
          = 299905.060 m E

N(ETRS89) = –208.185 –2.276 + 4500006.977
          = 4499796.515m N

Reverse computation of ETRS89 / UTM 31N coordinates 299905.060m E, 4499796.515m N:

E(ED50) = (300034.609 – 34.144) / 1.00000155
	= 300000.000m E

N(ED50) = (2.276 + 4500004.700) / 1.00000155
	= 4500000.000m N

Alternative reverse computation:

First calculate new parameter values:
XTO'   = 129.5472 m
YTO'   = 208.1857 m
M'     = 0.99999845
theta' = –0.000007588 rad

Then apply these values to forward formula:
E(ED50) = 129.547 + 299904.595 + (–34.142)
        = 300000.000 m

Re 4 - 	If conditions 1, 2 and 3 are all satisfied it then may be possible to use the forward polynomial algorithm with the forward parameters for the reverse transformation. This is the case if the spatial variations in dX and dY around any given location are sufficiently constant.  The signs of the polynomial coefficients are then reversed but the scaling factor and the evaluation point coordinates retain their signs. If these spatial variations in dX and dY are too large, for the reverse transformation iteration would be necessary.   It is therefore not the algorithm that determines whether a single step solution is sufficient or whether iteration is required, but the desired accuracy combined with the degree of spatial variability of dX and dY.

An example of a reversible polynomial is transformation is ED50 to ED87 (1) for the North Sea.  The suitability of this transformation to be described by a reversible polynomial can easily be explained. In the first place both source and target coordinate reference systems are of type geographic 2D. The typical difference in coordinate values between ED50 and ED87 is in the order of 2 metres (approximately 10E-6 degrees) in the area of application. The polynomial functions are evaluated about central points with coordinates of 55 deg N, 0 deg E in both coordinate reference systems. The reduced coordinate differences (in degrees) are used as input parameters to the polynomial functions. The output coordinate differences are corrections to the input coordinate offsets of about 10E-6 degrees. This difference of several orders of magnitude between input and output values is the property that makes a polynomial function reversible in practice (although not in a formal mathematical sense).

The error made by the polynomial approximation formulas in calculating the reverse correction is of the same order of magnitude as the ratio of output versus input:
(output error / input error) = (	output valu/ input value) which is approximately 10E-6

As long as the input values (the coordinate offsets from the evaluation point) are orders of magnitude larger than the output (the corrections), and provided the coefficients are used with changed signs, the polynomial transformation may be considered to be reversible.","See Reversible polynomial of degree 4, code 9651, for general methodology.",NaN,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,13-6-2017,2017.018,0

In Europe, national height systems are related to the pan-European height system through three transformation parameters and the formula:

Ht = Hs + A + [IncLat * rhoO * (Lat – LatO)] + [IncLong * nuO * (Long – LongO) * cos(Lat)]

where
Ht = gravity-related height value in the target vertical coordinate reference system.
Hs = gravity-related height value in the source vertical coordinate reference system.
A is the value of the vertical offset to be applied.
IncLat is the value in radians of the inclination parameter in the latitude domain, i.e. in the plane of the meridian, derived at an evaluation point with coordinates of LatO , LongO.
IncLon is the value of the inclination parameter in the longitude domain, i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the meridian.
rhoO is the radius of curvature of the meridian at latitude LatO, where rhoO = a(1 – e^2)/(1 – e^2 * sin^2(LatO))^1.5
nuO is the radius of curvature on the prime vertical (i.e. perpendicular to the meridian) at latitude LatO, wh		ere nuO = a /(1 – e^2 * sin^2(LatO))^0.5
Lat , Long are the horizontal coordinates of the point in the ETRS89 coordinate reference system, in radians.
LatO , LongO are the coordinates of the evaluation point in the ETRS89 coordinate reference system, in radians.

The horizontal location of the point must always be given in ETRS89 terms. Care is required where compound coordinate reference systems are in use: if the horizontal coordinates of the point are known in the local CRS they must first be transformed to ETRS89 values.

To derive the projected Easting and Northing coordinates of a point with geographical coordinates (lat,lon) the formulas for the one standard parallel case are:

E = EF + r sin(theta)
N = NF + rF - r cos(theta)
where
m = cos(lat)/(1 - e^2 sin^2(lat))^0.5     for m1, lat1, and m2, lat2 where lat1 and lat2 are the latitudes of the two standard parallels.
t  = tan(pi/4 - lat/2)/[(1 - e sin(lat))/(1 + e sin(lat))]^(e/2)   for t1, t2, tF and t using lat1, lat2, latF and lat respectively.
n = (loge(m1) - loge(m2))/(loge(t1) - loge(t2))
F = m1/(n  t1^n)
r =  a F t^n         for rF and r, where rF is the radius of the parallel of latitude of the false origin.
theta = n(lon - lon0)

The reverse formulas to derive the latitude and longitude of a point from its Easting and Northing values are:

lat = pi/2 - 2arctan{t'[(1 - esin(lat))/(1 + esin(lat))]^(e/2)}
lon = theta'/n +lon0
where
r' = +/-[(E - EF)^2 + {rF - (N - NF)}^2]^0.5 , taking the sign of n
t' = (r'/(aF))^(1/n)
theta' = atan2 [(E- EF),(rF - (N- NF))]
(see implementation notes in GN7-2 preface for atan2 convention)
and n, F, and rF are derived as for the forward calculation.

Note that the formula for lat requires iteration. First calculate t' and then a trial value for lat using 
lat = /2-2atan(t'). Then use the full equation for lat substituting the trial value into the right hand side of the equation. Thus derive a new value for lat. Iterate the process until lat does not change significantly. The solution should quickly converge, in 3 or 4 iterations.","Example 1 (Northern Hemisphere)

For the calculation of easting and northing from latitude and longitude, first calculate constants for the projection:

n = f / (2-f)
B = [a/(1+n)] (1 + n^2/4 + n^4/64)
		
h1 = n/2 – (2/3)n^2 + (5/16)n^3 + (41/180)n^4

h3 = (61/240)n^3 – (103/140)n^4
h4 = (49561/161280)n^4

Then the meridional arc distance from equator to the projection origin (Mo) is computed from:
If LatO = 0 then Mo = 0
else if LatO  90°N  /2 radians
   Mo = B (/2)
else if LatO  90°S  -/2 radians
   Mo = B (-/2)	
else
 Qo = asinh(tan LatO) – [e atanh(e sin LatO)]
 o = atan(sinh Qo)
 O0 = asin (sin o)
Note: The previous two steps are taken from the generic calculation flow given below for latitude Lat, but here for LatO may be simplified to O0 = o = atan(sinh Qo).
 O1 = h1 sin(2Oo)
 O2 = h2 sin(4Oo)

 O4 = h4 sin(8Oo) 
 O = O0+ O1+ O2+ O3+ O4
 Mo = B O

For the mapping of southern Africa a south oriented Transverse Mercator projection is used. Here the coordinate axes are called Westings and Southings and increment to the West and South from the origin respectively.  The standard Transverse Mercator formulas (coordinate operation method code 9807) need to be modified to cope with this arrangement with

Westing, W = FE - k0 nu[A + (1 - T + C)A^3/6 + (5 - 18*T + T^2 + 72*C - 58*e'^2)A^5/120]

In these formulas the terms FE and FN retain their definition, i.e. in the Transverse Mercator (South Orientated) method they increase the Westing and Southing value at the natural origin. In this method they are effectively false westing (FW) and false southing (FS) respectively.

For the reverse formulas, those for the standard Transverse Mercator above apply, with the exception that:

M1 = M0 - (S - FN)/k0
and D = -(W - FE)/(nu1*k0), with nu1 = nu for lat1","See Transverse Mercator, code 9807, for general methodology.",NaN,"EPSG guidance note #7-2, http://www.epsg.org",EPSG,13-6-2017,2002.510 2017.018,0

Given the geodetic origin of the projection at the tangent point (lat0, lon0), the parameters defining the conformal sphere are:

R= sqrt( rho0 * nu0)
n= {1 + [e^2 * cos^4(latC) / (1 - e^2)]}^0.5
c=  [(n+sin(lat0)) (1-sin(chi0))]/[(n-sin(lat0)) (1+sin(chi0))]

where:
sin(chi0) = (w1-1)/(w1+1)
w1 = (S1.(S2)^e)^n
S1 = (1+sin(lat0))/(1-sin(lat0))
S2 = (1-e sin(lat0))/(1+e sin(lat0))

The conformal latitude and longitude (chi0,lambda0) of the origin are then computed from :

chi0 = asin[(w2-1)/(w2+1)]

where S1 and S2 are as above and  w2 = c (S1(S2)^e)^n
 
lambda0  = lon0

For any point with geodetic coordinates (lat, lon) the equivalent conformal latitude and longitude (chi, lambda) are computed from 
lambda = n(lon-lambda0) + lambda0
chi = asin[(w-1)/(w+1)]

where w = c (Sa (Sb)^e)^n
Sa = (1+sin(lat))/(1-sin(lat))
Sb = (1-e.sin(lat))/(1+e.sin(lat))
 
Then B = [1+sin(chi) sin(chi0) + cos(chi) cos(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)]

N = FN + 2 R k0 [sin(chi) cos(chi0) - cos(chi) sin(chi0) cos(lambda-lambda0)] / B

E = FE + 2 R k0 cos(chi) sin(lambda-lambda0) / B


The reverse formulae to compute the geodetic coordinates from the grid coordinates involves computing the conformal values, then the isometric latitude and finally the geodetic values.

The parameters of the conformal sphere and conformal latitude and longitude at the origin are computed as above. Then for any point with Stereographic grid coordinates (E,N) :

chi = chi0 + 2 atan[{(N-FN)-(E-FE) tan (j/2)} / (2 R k0)]

lambda = j + 2 i + lambda0

where g = 2 R k0 tan(pi/4 - chi0/2)
h = 4 R k0 tan(chi0) + g
i = atan2[(E-FE) , {h+(N-FN)}]
j = atan2[(E-FE) , (g-(N-FN)] - i
(see GN7-2 implementation notes in preface for atan2 convention)

Geodetic longitude lon = (lambda-lambda0 ) / n +  lambda0

Isometric latitude psi = 0.5 ln [(1+ sin(chi)) / { c (1-  sin(chi))}] / n

First approximation lat1 = 2 atan(e^psi)  - pi/2  where e=base of natural logarithms.

psii = isometric latitude at lati

where psii= ln[{tan(lati/2 + pi/4}  {(1-e sin(lati))/(1+e sin(lati))}^(e/2)]
 
Then iterate lat(i+1) = lati - ( psii - psi ) cos(lati) (1 -e^2 sin^2(lati)) / (1 - e^2)

until the change in lat is sufficiently small.

For Oblique Stereographic projections centred on points in the southern hemisphere,  the signs of E, N, lon0, lon,  must be reversed to be used in the equations and lat will be negative anyway as a southerly latitude.

An alternative approach is given by Snyder, where, instead of defining a single conformal sphere at the origin point, the conformal latitude at each point on the ellipsoid is computed.  The conformal longitude is then always equivalent to the geodetic longitude.  This approach is a valid alternative to the above, but gives slightly different results away from the origin point. It is therefore considered by EPSG to be a different coordinate operation method to that described above.",For Projected Coordinate System RD / Netherlands New

This grid is used as the basis for mineral leasing in Tunsia.  Lease areas are approximately 2 x 2 km or 400 hectares.  The southwest corner of these blocks is defined through a six figure grid reference where the first three digits are an easting in kilometres and the last three digits are a northing.  The origin of the grid is Djebel Kebar at 38.81973gN, 7.83445gE of Paris at which the grid reference is 270582. The latitudes and longitudes for block corners at 2 km intervals are tabulated in a mining decree dated 1st January 1953.  From this tabulation in which geographical coordinates are given to 5 decimal places it can be seen that:
a)  the minimum easting is 94 km, on which the longitude is 5.68989 grads east of Paris.
b)  the maximum easting is 490 km, on which the longitude is 10.51515 grads east of Paris.
c)  each 2 km grid easting interval equals 0.02437 grads.
d)  the minimum northing is 40 km, on which the latitude is 33.39 grads.
e)  the maximum northing is 860 km, on which the latitude is 41.6039 grads.
f)  between 40 km N and 360 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02004 grads.
g)  between 360 km N and 860 km N, each 2 km grid northing interval equals 0.02003 grads.

From the above the latitude of N=360 can be determined to be 36.5964gN.

Formulae are:

Grads from Paris

Lat = LatO + [(N - Nf) * A] 
where Lat and LatO are in grads, N and Nf are in kilometres and A = 0.010015 if N > Nf, else A = 0.01002.

Lon = LonO + [(E - Ef) * 0.012185]

r' = +/- {(E –  FE)^2 + [rO –  (N –  FN)]}^2}^0.5, taking the sign of latO 
M' = rO – r'

If an exact solution is required, it is necessary to solve for m and lat using iteration of the two equations:
m'= 	m' – [M' – ko m' – ko A (m')^3] / [– ko – 3 ko A (m')^2]
using M' for m' in the first iteration. This will usually converge (to within 1mm) in a single iteration. Then
lat' = lat' +{m' + sO – [A' lat' (180/pi) – B' sin(2 lat')  + C' sin(4 lat')  –  D' sin(6lat') + E' sin(8 lat')]}/A' (pi/180)
first using lat' = latO + m'/A' (pi/180).

However the following non-iterative solution is accurate to better than 0.001"" (3mm) within 5 degrees latitude of the projection origin and should suffice for most purposes:
m' = 	M' – [M' ko M' – ko A (M')^3] / [– ko – 3 ko A (M')^2]
lat' = latO + m'/A' (pi/180)
s' = A	' lat' –  B' sin(2 lat')  + C' sin(4 lat')  –  D' sin(6 lat') + E' sin(8 lat')
		where in the first term lat' is in degrees, in the other terms lat' is in radians.
Ds' = 	A'(180 / pi) – 2B' cos(2 lat')  + 4C' cos(4 lat')  –  6D' cos(6 lat') + 8E' cos(8 lat')

This general case deals with a viewing point at a finite height hv above the origin. If the viewing point is at infinity, the formulas for the orthographic case (method code 9839) should be used.

The forward equations for the Vertical Perspective to convert geographical 3D coordinates (lat, lon, h) to Easting (E) and Northing (N) begin with the formulas of thje Geographic/topocentric conversions method (code 9836) to convert the geographical coordinates to topocentric coordinates U, V, W. The perspective projection origin is coincident with the topographic origin and has coordinates (latO, lonO, hO).

U = (nu + h) cos P sin (L – Lo)
V = (nu + h) [sin P cos Po – cos P sin Po cos (L – Lo)] + e^2 (nuO sin Po – nu sin P ) cos Po 
W = (nu + h) [sin P sin Po + cos P cos Po cos (L – Lo)] + e^2 (nuO sin Po – nu sin P ) sin Po – (nuO – ho)

Then, given the height hv of the perspective viewing point above the origin, the perspective coordinates (E, N) are calculated from topocentric coordinates (U, V, W) as:

E = U * hv / (hv – W)
N = V * hv / (hv – W)

The orthographic vertical perspective is a special case of the vertical perspective with the viewing point (hv) at infinity. Therefore, all projection ""rays"" are parallel to one another and all are perpendicular to the tangent plane. Since the rays are parallel, coordinates in the tangent-plane are the same in any other parallel mapping plane, i.e. are consistent for any value of ho, which therefore becomes irrelevant to the forward formulas.

The Orthographic Projection forward conversion from 2D geographic coordinates latitude and longitude (lat, lon) and the origin on the ellipsoid (latO, lonO) is given by:

E = FE + nu cos(lat) sin (lon – lonO)
N = FN + nu [sin(lat) cos(latO) – cos(lat) sin(latO) cos (lon – lonO)] + e^2 (nuO sin(latO) – nu sin(lat)) cos(latO) 

where
nu is the prime vertical radius of curvature at latitude lat; nu = a /(1 – e^2 sin^2(lat))^0.5,
nuO is the prime vertical radius of curvature at latitude of origin latO; nuO = a /(1 – e^2 sin^2(latO)^0.5,
e is the eccentricity of the ellipsoid and e^2 = (a^2 – b^2)/a^2 = 2f – f^2
a and b are the ellipsoidal semi-major and semi-minor axes,
1/f is the inverse flattening, and 
the latitude and longitude of the projection origin are latO and lonO.

These formulas are similar to those for the orthographic case of the vertical perspective (method code 9839) except that, for the Orthographic Projection given here, h = 0 and the term (nu + h) reduces to nu. The projection origin is at the topocentric system origin latO, lonO with false origin coordinates FE and FN. 

For the reverse formulas for latitude and longitude corresponding to a given Easting (E) and Northing (N), iteration is required as the prime vertical radius (nu) is a function of latitude. 

Begin by seeding the iteration with the center of projection (or some better guess): 
lat = latO
lon = lonO

Enter the iteration here with the (next) best estimates of lat and lon. Then solve for the radii of curvature in the prime vertical (nu) and meridian (rho):
nu = a / (1 – e^2 sin^2(lat))^0.5
rho = a (1 – e^2) / (1 – e^2 sin^2(lat))^1.5

Compute test values of E and N (E' and N') using the forward equations:
E' = FE + nu cos(lat) sin(lon – lonO)
N' = FN + nu [sin(lat) cos(latO) – cos(lat) sin(latO) cos(lon – lonO)] + e^2 (nuO sin(latO) – nu sin(lat) ) cos(latO)

Partially differentiate the forward equations to solve for the elements of the Jacobian matrix: 
J11 = dE/dlat = – rho sin(lat) sin(lon – lonO) 
J12 = dE/dlon = nu cos(lat) cos(lon – lonO) 
J21 = dN/dlat = rho [cos(lat) cos(latO) + sin(lat) sin(latO) cos(lon – lonO)]
J22 = dN/dlon = nu sin(latO) cos(lat) sin (lon – lonO) 

Solve for the determinant of the Jacobian:
D = J11 J22 – J12 J21

Solve the northerly and easterly differences this iteration: 
dE = E – E'
dN= N – N'

Adjust the latitude and longitude for the next iteration by inverting the Jacobian and multiplying by the differences: 
lat = lat + (J22 dE – J12 dN) / D
lon = lon + (–J21 dE + J11 dN) / D

Formulas are included to distinguish this map projection method from an approach sometimes mistakenly called by the same name and used for simple computer display of geographic coordinates - see Pseudo Plate Carrée (coordinate operation method code 9825).







For the forward calculation:







E =  FE + R . (lon - lonO) . cos(lat1)



N =  FN + R . lat







where lat1, lonO, lat and lon are expressed in radians.







R is the radius of the sphere and will normally be one of the CRS parameters. If the figure of the earth used is an ellipsoid rather than a sphere then R should be calculated as the radius of the conformal sphere at the projection origin at latitude lat1 using the formula for RC given in EPSG Guidance Note 7-2, section 1.2, table 3. Note however that if applying spherical formula to ellipsoidal coordinates, the equidistant projection properties are not preserved.







For the reverse calculation:

From the defining parameters the following constants for the projection may be calculated :

A = a(1 - e^2)^0.5 / [1 - e^2 sin^2.(latC)]
B = {1 + [e^2 * cos^4(latC) / (1 - e^2)]}^0.5
gammao = asin[sin(latC) / B]
to = tan(pi/4 + gammao/2).[(1 + e sin(latC)) / (1 - e sin(latC))]^(e.B/2) / [tan(pi/4 + latC/2)]^B
n = sin(latp)
ro = kp.A / tan(latp)

To derive the projected Southing and Westing coordinates of a point with geographical coordinates (lat, lon) the formulas for the Krovak are:

U = 2(atan{to.tan^B(lat/2 + pi/4) / [(1 + e sin(lat)) / (1 - e sin(lat))]^[e.B/2]} - pi/4)
V = B(lonO - lon) where lonO and lon must both be referenced to the same prime meridian.
T = asin[cos(alphaC).sin(U) + sin(alphaC).cos(U). cos(V)]
D = asin[cos(U).sin(V)/cos(T)]
theta = n.D
r = ro.tan^n(pi/4 + latp/2) / tan^n(T/2 + pi/4)
Xp = r.cos(theta)
Yp = r.sin(theta)
Southing = Xp + FN
Westing = Yp + FE

Then Easting = -Westing
     Northing = -Southing

Note also that the formula for D is satisfactory for the normal use of the projection within the pseudo-longitude range on the conformal sphere of ±90 degrees from the central line of the projection. Should there be a need to exceed this range (which is not necessary for application in Czechia and Slovakia) then for the calculation of D use:
sin(D1) = cos(U) * sin(V) / cos(T)
cos(D1) = {[cos(alphaC)*sin(T) – sin(U)] / [sin(alphaC)*cos(T)]}
D =  atan2(sin(D1) , cos(D1))  (see implementation notes in preface for atan2 convention)


The reverse formulas to derive the latitude and longitude of a point from its Easting and Northing values are:
Southing = -Northing
Westing = -Easting
Xp' = Southing – FN
Yp' = Westing – FE
r' = [(Yp')^2 + (Xp')^2]^(1/2)  
theta' = atan2[Yp' , Xp'] (see GN7-2 implementation notes in preface for atan2 convention)
D' = theta' / sin(latp)

U' = asin[cos(alphaC).sin(T') - sin(alphaC).cos(T').cos(D')]
V' = asin(cos(T').sin(D') / cos(U'))

Then latitude lat is found by iteration using U' as the value for lat(j-1) in the first iteration:
lat(j) = 2*(atan{to^(-1/B) tan^(1/B).(U'/2 + pi/4).[(1 + e sin(lat(j-1)) / (1 - e sin(lat(j-1))]^(e/2)} - pi/4)

Forward:
To derive the projected coordinates of a point, geodetic latitude (lat) is converted to authalic latitude (ß). The formulae to convert geodetic latitude and longitude (lat,lon) to Easting (E) and Northing (N) are:

Easting, E = FE + Rq 2 (lon – lonO) cos() / {3 [1.340264 – 0.243318 ^2 + ^6 (0.006251 + 0.034164 ^2)]}
Northing, N = FN + Rq  [1.340264 – 0.081106 ^2 + ^6 (0.000893 + 0.003796 ^2)]

where
	=	asin [sin(ß) 3 / 2]
Rq	=	a (qP  / 2)^0.5
ß	=	asin(q / qP)
q	=	(1 – e^2) ({sin(lat)/ [1 – e^2 sin^2(lat)]} – 1/(2e) ln{[1 – e sin(lat)] / [1 + e sin(lat)]})

qP	=	(1 – e^2) ({sin(latP)/ [1 – e^2 sin^2(latP)]} – 1/(2e) ln{[1 – e sin(latP)] / [1 + e sin(latP)]})

		where latP = /2 radians, thus

qP	=	(1 – e^2) ([1 / (1 – e^2)] – {[1/(2e)]  ln [(1 – e) / (1 + e)]})


Reverse:
The reverse conversion from easting and northing to latitude and longitude requires iteration of northing (N) equation to obtain . 0 = (N–FN) / Rq  is used as the first trial . A correction n is calculated and subtracted from the trial n value to obtain the next trial n+1. n is the suffix number of iteration.

0 = (N–FN) / Rq
0 = { 0 [1.340264 – 0.081106 0^2 + 0^6 (0.000893 + 0.003796 0^2)] – [N–FN] / Rq} / 
 					{1.340264 – 0.243318 0^2 + 0^6 [0.006251 + 0.034164 0^2]}

etc.

The calculation is repeated until n is less than a predetermined convergence value. Then, using the final n+1 as , the geodetic latitude and longitude of a point are determined as follows: 

	lat = ß + {[(e^2/3 + 31e^4/180 + 517e^6/5040) sin(2ß)] + [(23e^4/360 + 251e^6/3780) sin(4ß)]

In France the national mapping agency (IGN) has promolgated a transformation between the old geographic 2D coordinate reference system NTF and the modern 3-dimensional system RGF93 which uses geocentric translations interpolated from a grid file. This is a two-step operation which first requires interpolation of a gridded dataset in the geographic 2D domain to obtain the geocentric translations, then the transformation is made using the Geocentric translations method. It is described in IGN document NTG-88. The method has also been used in New Caledonia. In summary:
•	The grid file nodes are referenced to the modern (RGF93 in France) geographic 2D CRS (the Interpolation CRS).
•	Within the grid file the sense of the parameter values is from old to modern (for France, NTF to RGF93), that is the offsets are additive when the old CRS (in France, NTF) is the source CRS and the modern CRS (in France, RGF93) is the target CRS.

For the forward transformation, old CRS to modern CRS, because the interpolation CRS is not the source CRS, in principle iteration is required. The source CRS coordinates are used for the initial bi-linear interpolation of the grid to obtain preliminary geocentric translation offsets. These are applied to calculate provisional target CRS coordinates:
  X't = Xs + tX
  Y't = Ys + tY
  Z't = Zs + tZ
This process is iterated until the changes in target coordinates are insignificant. 

An approximation to an accuracy of 1cm may be made if a suitable 'standard transformation' is available. This avoids iteration. The steps for the forward transformation then are:
•	Convert source CRS coordinates to interpolation CRS coordinates by using the standard transformation.	
•	Using these, interpolate within the grid file to obtain the three geocentric translations (tX, tY, tZ) applicable at the point.
•	Using the Geocentric translation (geog 2D domain) method,  transform coordinates of the point in the source CRS to the target CRS:
  Xt = Xs + tX
  Yt = Ys + tY
  Zt = Zs + tZ

For the reverse transformation from modern CRS (in France, RGF93) to old CRS (in France, NTF) where the modern CRS is the Interpolation CRS, the steps are:
•	Using the modern (RGF93) geographic coordinates, interpolate within the grid file to obtain the three geocentric translations (tX, tY, tZ) applicable at the point.
•	Transform modern CRS (RGF93) coordinates to old CRS (NTF) coordinates, taking into account the sense of the geocentric translation parameter values: 
  X(old) = X(modern)+(– tX) which for France may be expressed as X(NTF) = X(RGF93)+(– tX)
  Y(old) = Y(modern)+(– tY) which for France may be expressed as Y(NTF) = Y(RGF93)+(– tY)
  Z(old) = Z(modern)+(– tZ) which for France may be expressed as Z(NTF) = Z(RGF93)+(– tZ)","Forward transformation from NTF to RGF93 for a point in France with NTF coordinates of:

This transformation avoids iteration in the forward direction by first using NTF to ETRS89 (1) (EPSG coordinate transformation code 1651) as the 'standard transformation'. This uses the Geocentric translations (geog2D domain) method, code 9603, with parameter values of

but if n is negative the signs of both arguments of the atan2 function  must be reversed and theta' = atan2{– (E –  Ef) , – [rf – (N –  Nf)]}

Note that the formula for lat requires iteration. First calculate t' and then a trial value for lat using 
lat = /2-2atan(t'). Then use the full equation for lat substituting the trial value into the right hand side of the equation. Thus derive a new value for lat. Iterate the process until lat does not change significantly. The solution should quickly converge, in 3 or 4 iterations.","Parameters:

Latitude, P, and Longitude, L, in terms of Geographic Coordinate Reference System A may 
be expressed in terms of a geocentric (earth centred) Cartesian coordinate reference system X, Y, Z 
with the Z axis corresponding with the Polar axis positive northwards, the X axis through 
the intersection of the Greenwich meridian and equator, and the Y axis through the 
intersection of the equator with longitude 90 degrees E. If the prime meridian for geogCRS A is not 
Greewich, longitudes must first be transformed to their Greenwich equivalent. If the earth's 
spheroidal semi major axis is a, semi minor axis  b, and inverse flattening 1/f,  then

   X =   (nu + h) cos P cos L
   Y =   (nu + h) cos P sin L
   Z =  ((1 - e^2) nu + h) sin P

where nu is the prime vertical radius of curvature at latitude P and is equal to 
   nu = a /(1 - e^2*sin^2(P))^0.5,
   P and L are respectively the latitude and longitude (related to Greenwich) of the point 
   h is height above the ellipsoid, (topographic height plus geoidal height), and
   e is the eccentricity of the ellipsoid where e^2 = (a^2 -b^2)/a^2 = 2f -f^2
                                                                                                                                                 
Cartesian coordinates in geocentric coordinate reference system B may be used to derive geographical coordinates in terms of geographic coordinate reference system B by:
           
P = atan2[(Z + eta b sin^3 q) , (p – e^2 a cos^3 q)]  
L  = atan2 (Y,X)
(see implementation notes in GN7-2 preface for atan2 convention)

where
eta = e^2 / (1 – e^2)
b = a(1 – f)
p = (X^2 + Y^2)^0.5
q = atan[(Z a) / (p b)]

and where L is relative to Greenwich. If the geographic system has a non Greenwich prime meridian, the Greenwich value of the local prime meridian should be applied to longitude.

Then
  	h (p / cos P) – nu

(Note that h is the height above the ellipsoid. This is the height value which is delivered by Transit and GPS satellite observations but is not the topographic height value which is normally used for national mapping and levelling operations. The topographic height is usually the height above mean sea level or an alternative 
level reference for the country. If one starts with a topographic height,  it will be necessary to convert it to an ellipsoid height before using the above transformation formulas. h = N + H, where N is the geoid height above the ellipsoid at the point and is sometimes negative, and H is the height of the point above the geoid. The height above the geoid is often taken to be that above mean sea level, perhaps with a constant correction applied. Geoid heights of points above the nationally used ellipsoid may not be readily available. For the WGS84 ellipsoid the value of N, 
representing the height of the geoid relative to the ellipsoid, can vary between values of -100m in the Sri Lanka area to +80m in the North Atlantic.)","Consider a North Sea point with coordinates derived by GPS satellite in the WGS 84 geographical coordinate system with coordinates of:

           latitude    53 deg 48 min 33.82 sec N, 
           longitude 02 deg 07 min 46.38 sec E, 
    and ellipsoidal height 73.0m, 

whose coordinates are required in terms of the ED50 geographical coordinate system which takes the International 1924 ellipsoid. The three parameter datum shift from WGS 84 to ED50 for this North Sea area is given as dX = +84.87m, dY = +96.49m, dZ = +116.95m. 

The WGS 84 geographical coordinates convert to the following geocentric values using the above formulas for X, Y, Z:

   XA = 3771 793.97m
   YA =   140 253.34m
   ZA = 5124 304.35m

Applying the quoted datum shifts to these, we obtain new geocentric values now related to ED50:

   XB = 3771 878.84m
   YB =   140 349.83m
   ZB = 5124 421.30m

These convert to ED50 values on the International 1924 ellipsoid as:
           latitude    53 deg 48 min 36.565 sec N, 
           longitude 02 deg 07 min 51.477 sec E, 
    and ellipsoidal height 28.02 m, 

Note that the derived height is referred to the International 1924 ellipsoidal surface and will need a further correction for the height of the geoid at this point in order to relate it to Mean Sea Level.","This is a parameter-less conversion.

The two axes are orthogonal, but the unit on the I-axis is 25 metres, whilst the unit on the J-axis is 12.5 metres.

The map grid bearing of the I and J axes are 110* and 20* respectively.  Thus the angle through which both the positive I and J axes need to be rotated to coincide with the positive Easting axis and Northing axis respectively is +20 degrees.

ro = kp.A / tan(latp)

To derive the projected Southing and Westing coordinates of a point with geographical coordinates (lat, lon) the formulas for the Krovak are:

U = 2(atan{to.tan^B(lat/2 + pi/4) / [(1 + e sin(lat)) / (1 - e sin(lat))]^[e.B/2]} - pi/4)
V = B(lonO - lon) where lonO and lon must both be referenced to the same prime meridian.
T = asin[cos(alphaC).sin(U) + sin(alphaC).cos(U). cos(V)]
D = asin[cos(U).sin(V)/cos(T)]
theta = n.D
r = ro.tan^n(pi/4 + latp/2) / tan^n(T/2 + pi/4)
Xp = r.cos(theta)
Yp = r.sin(theta)

Then	
Southing (X) = Xp + FN
Westing	 (Y) = Yp + FE

Note also that the formula for D is satisfactory for the normal use of the projection within the pseudo-longitude range on the conformal sphere of ±90 degrees from the central line of the projection. Should there be a need to exceed this range (which is not necessary for application in Czechia and Slovakia) then for the calculation of D use:
sin(D1)  =  cos(U) * sin(V) / cos(T)
cos(D1) =  {[cos(alphaC)*sin(T) – sin(U)] / [sin(alphaC)*cos(T)]}
D = atan2(sin(D1) , cos(D1))  (see implementation notes in preface for atan2 convention)


The reverse formulas to derive the latitude and longitude of a point from its Southing and Westing values are:

Xp' = Southing – FN
Yp' = Westing – FE
r' = [(Yp')^2 + (Xp')^2]^(1/2)  
theta' = atan2[Yp' , Xp'] (see GN7-2 implementation notes in preface for atan2 convention)
D' = theta' / sin(latp)
T' = 2{atan[((ro / r')^(1/n)).tan(pi/4 + latp/2)] - pi/4}
U' = asin[cos(alphaC).sin(T') - sin(alphaC).cos(T').cos(D')]
V' = asin(cos(T').sin(D') / cos(U'))

Then latitude lat is found by iteration using U' as the value for lat(j-1) in the first iteration:
lat(j) = 2*(atan{to^(-1/B) tan^(1/B).(U'/2 + pi/4).[(1 + e sin(lat(j-1)) / (1 - e sin(lat(j-1))]^(e/2)} - pi/4)

Oblique aspect
To derive the projected coordinates of a point, geodetic latitude (lat) is converted to authalic latitude (ß). The formulae  to convert geodetic latitude and longitude (lat,lon) to Easting and Northing are:

Easting, E   = FE + {(B . D) . [cos ß . sin(lon – lonO)]}
Northing, N = FN + (B / D) . {(cos ßO . sin ß) –  [sin ßO . cos ß . cos(lon – lonO)]}

where
B = Rq . (2 / {1 + sin ßO . sin ß + [cos ßO . cos ß . cos(lon – lonO)]})^0.5
D = a . [cos latO / (1 – e2 sin2 latO)^0.5] / (Rq . cos ßO)
Rq = a . (qP  / 2)^0.5
ß = asin (q / qP)
ßO = asin (qO / qP)
q = (1 – e^2) . ([sin(lat) / (1 – e^2 sin^2(lat))] – {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1 – e sin(lat)) / (1 + e sin(lat))]})
qO = (1 – e^2) . ([sin(latO) / (1 – e^2 sin^2(latO))] – {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1 – e sin(latO)) / (1 + e sin(latO))]})
qP = (1 – e^2) . ([sin(latP) / (1 – e^2 sin^2(latP))] – {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1 – e sin(latP)) / (1 + e sin(latP))]})
where *P = p/2 radians, thus
qP = (1 – e^2) . ([1 / (1 – e^2)] – {[1/(2e)] . ln [(1 – e) / (1 + e)]})

The reverse formulas to derive the geodetic latitude and longitude of a point from its Easting and Northing values are:

lat = ß' + [(e^2/3 + 31e^4/180 + 517e^6/5040) . sin 2ß'] + [(23e^4/360 + 251e^6/3780) . sin 4ß'] +  [(761e^6/45360) . sin 6ß']

lon = lonO + atan2 {(E-FE) . sin C , [D. rho . cos ßO . cos C – D^2. (N-FN) . sin ßO . sin C]}  (see implementation notes in GN7-2 preface for atan2 convention)
where
ß' = asin{(cosC . sin ßO) + [(D . (N-FN) . sinC . cos ßO) / rho]}
C = 2 . asin(rho / 2 . Rq)
rho = {[(E-FE)/D]^2 + [D . (N –FN)]^2}^0.5

and D, Rq, and ßO are as in the forward equations.

Polar aspect
For the polar aspect of the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, some of the above equations are indeterminate. Instead, for the forward case from latitude and longitude (lat, lon) to Easting (E) and Northing (N):

For the north polar case:
	Easting, E   = FE + [rho  sin(lon – lonO)]
	Northing, N = FN –  [rho  cos(lon – lonO)]
where
rho = a (qP  – q)^0.5
and qP  and q are found as for the general case above.

For the south polar case:
	Easting, E   = FE + [rho . sin(lon – lonO)]
	Northing, N = FN +  [rho . cos(lon – lonO)]
where
rho = a (qP  + q)^0.5
and qP  and q are found as for the general case above.

For the reverse formulas to derive the geodetic latitude and longitude of a point from its Easting and Northing:
lat = ß' + [(e^2/3 + 31e^4/180 + 517e^6/5040)  sin 2ß'] + [(23e^4/360 + 251e^6/3780)  sin 4ß'] +  [(761e^6/45360)  sin 6ß']
as for the oblique case, but where
ß' = ±asin [1– rho^2 / (a^2{1– [(1– e^2)/2e)) ln[(1-e)/(1+ e)]})], taking the sign of  latO
and rho = {[(E –FE)]^2 + [(N – FN)]^2}^0.5
Then
lon = lonO + atan2 [(E – FE)] , (N – FN)] for the south pole case
and
lon = lonO + atan2 [(E – FE)] , –(N – FN)] for the north pole case.

This method is utilised by some popular web mapping and visualisation applications. It applies standard Mercator (Spherical) formulas (method code 1026) to ellipsoidal coordinates and the sphere radius is taken to be the semi-major axis of the ellipsoid. This approach only approximates to the more rigorous application of ellipsoidal formulas to ellipsoidal coordinates (as given in EPSG dataset coordinate operation method codes 9804 and 9805).  Unlike either the spherical or ellipsoidal Mercator projection methods, this method is not conformal: scale factor varies as a function of azimuth, which creates angular distortion. Despite angular distortion there is no convergence in the meridian. 

The formulas to derive projected Easting and Northing coordinates from ellipsoidal latitude (lat) and longitude (lon) first derive the radius of the sphere (R) from:
	R = a

Then applying spherical Mercator formulae:

	E = FE + R(lon - lonO)              
	N = FN + R ln[tan(pi/4 + lat/2)]                   
where FE and FN are false easting and false nothing at the projection origin, other symbols are as listed above and logarithms are natural.

If latitude lat = 90º, N is infinite. The above formula for N will fail near to the pole, and should not be used poleward of 88º.

The reverse formulas to derive latitude and longitude on the sphere from E and N values are:
	D = -(N-FN)/R = (FN-N)/R
	lat = pi/2 - 2 atan(e^D) where e=base of natural logarithms, 2.7182818...
	lon = [(E - FE)/R] + lonO


If q_alpha is the scale factor at a given azimuth alpha, it is a function of R', the radius of curvature at that azimuth derived from:
	R' = rho nu / (nu cos^2alpha + rho sin^2alpha)
	q_alpha = R / (R' cos lat)
where rho and nu are the radii of curvature of the ellipsoid at latitude lat in the plane of the meridian and perpendicular to the meridian respectively;
rho = a(1 - e^2)/(1 - e^2 sin^2(lat))^3/2
nu = a /(1 - e^2 sin^2(lat))^1/2

Then when the azimuth is 0º, 180º, 90º or 270º the scale factors in the meridian (h) and on the parallel (k) are:
	q_0 = q_180  = h = R / (rho cos(lat))
	q_90 = q_270 = k = R / (nu cos(lat))
which demonstrates the non-conformallity of the Pseudo Mercator method.

Ht = Hs + A + [IncLat * rhoO * (Lat – LatO)] + [IncLong * nuO * (Long
– LongO) * cos(Lat)]

Ht = gravity-related height value in the target vertical coordinate reference system.
Hs = gravity-related height value in the source vertical coordinate reference system.
A is the value of the vertical offset to be applied.
IncLat is the value in radians of the inclination parameter in the latitude domain, i.e. in the plane of the meridian, derived at an evaluation point with coordinates of LatO, LongO.
IncLon is the value of the inclination parameter in the longitude domain, i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the meridian.
rhoO is the radius of curvature of the meridian at latitude LatO, where rhoO = a(1 – e^2)/(1 – e^2 * sin^2(LatO))^1.5
nuO is the radius of curvature on the prime vertical (i.e. perpendicular to the meridian) at latitude LatO, where nuO = a /(1 – e^2 * sin^2(LatO))^0.5
LatO , LongO are the coordinates of the evaluation point in the 'Horizontal CRS' coordinate reference system, in radians. The ID of the 'Horizontal CRS' is a defining parameter.
Lat , Long are the horizontal coordinates of the point in the same coordinate reference system as the evaluation point (the 'Horizontal CRS'), in radians.

ETRS89 longitude: 9 deg 40min E of Greenwich = 0.168715161 radians

Then rhoO = 6369526.88 m 
IncLat term = -0.047 m 
nuO = 6389555.64 m  
incLong term = -0.017 m
whence EVRF2000 height (Ht) = 473.0 +(-0.245) + (-0.047) + (-0.017) = 472.690 m.,This transformation allows calculation of height in the target system by applying the parameter values to the height value of the point in the source system.,"OGP",EPSG,16-10-2017,2011.108 2014.027,0

The P6 (I = J-90) seismic bin grid operation is a special case of the Affine Geometric Transformation (method code 9623). In practice bin grid definitions are based on an identified map grid. As such the example bin grids in the EPSG Dataset are described with the map grid (projected CRS) as source CRS. However to retain consistency with the syntax used in the description of the affine geometric transformation, in the formulas below the bin grid is the affine source CRS and the map grid is the affine target CRS.

where:

XT0 ,YT0  = the map grid coordinates (easting, northing) of the origin point of the bin grid;
dSX , dSY  = the length of one unit of the bin, expressed in units of the map grid, for the bin grid I and J axes respectively;
k = point scale factor in the map grid at a chosen reference point;
q  = the angle through which the bin grid axes must be rotated to coincide with the map grid axes (counter-clockwise is positive). Alternatively, the bearing (clockwise positive) of the bin grid system J-axis measured relative to map grid north.","This example is given in the OGP P6/11 user guide. 

The bin grid is based on projected CRS NAD27/ BLM 16N (ftUS) in which the origin of the bin grid is defined at east = 871200.0 ftUS, north = 10280160.0 ftUS. As the survey was acquired on the map grid, the bin grid scale factor at the bin grid origin is defined to be 1.

The bin width on the I-axis (XS axis) is 82.5 US survey feet, whilst the bin width on the J-axis (YS axis) is 41.25 US survey feet. The origin of the bin grid has bin values of I=5000, J=0.

In the map grid, the bearing of the bin grid I and J axes are 250° and 340° respectively. The latter is one of the transformation parameters.

The transformation parameter values are:

Bin grid origin I:                   5000 bins
Bin grid origin J:                   0 bins

The NTv2_Vel grid contains point velocities resolved into north, east, and up components.

First the three velocities at a point are interpolated within the NTv2_Vel grid using bi-linear interpolation within the source and target CRS.

Then ellipsoidal coordinates of a point at coordinate epoch t1 may be calculated at any other coordinate epoch t2 from:

[Lat(t2)] = [Lat(t1)] + (t2-t1) * [V_lat]
[Lon(t2)] = [Lon(t1)] + (t2-t1) * [V_lon]
[h(t2)] = [h(t1)] + (t2-t1) * [V_up]

where V describes the velocities of the ellipsoidal coordinates. These are given as a rate in linear units (metres per year) resolved into north, east and up components VN, VE and Vh. The north and east components are converted into latitude and longitude components by:
	V_lat = VN / (rho+h)
	V_lon = VE / [(nu+h) cos(lat)]

	rho is radius of curvature of the CRS's ellipsoid in the plane of the meridian at latitude lat

1071,Vertical Offset by Grid Interpolation (NZLVD),1,"The relationship between NZVD16 height and thirteen local gravity-related coordinate reference systems (LVDs) for New Zealand is available through gridded data files of offsets (sometimes called height differences). The vertical offset at a point is first interpolated within the grid of values using bi-linear interpolation. For interpolation within the offset grids, horizontal positions in the NZGD2000 geographic 2D CRS are used.

The interpolated value is then applied as an offset:
•	If the height in a LVD is required when a NZVD2016 height is given, add the interpolated offset to the NZVD2016 height (LVD height = NZVD2016 height + interpolated offset).
•	If the NZVD2016 height is required when a LVD height is given, subtract the interpolated offset from the LVD height (NZVD2016 height = LVD height - interpolated offset).


Care! In the EPSG Dataset, offsets are additive (for the forward transformation). See EPSG Guidance Note 7-2, Implementation Notes - Offsets. The LINZ convention assumes that the offset is subtracted, and grid file names reflect that convention. The offset files therefore have names which conflict with the source and target CRSs of the EPSG transformation.","For a point in the Dunedin 1958 height area at 44.42°S, 168.92°E (NZGD2000) with NZVD2016 height of 50.000 metres, to find its Dunedin 1958 height:

1076,Wellbore local to geographic (LMP),1,"Note: These formulas have been transcribed from EPSG Guidance Note #7-2. Users are encouraged to use that document rather than the text which follows as reference because limitations in the transcription will be avoided.

LMP requires that the input local horizontal coordinates are referenced to true north, and that depths (D) are referenced to the reference surface of the vertical CRS. Depths are required as input but are not changed by the algorithm. They are used to compute the depth correction factor and therefore a depth of zero must be close to Mean Sea Level (strictly speaking to the reference ellipsoid).

Required inputs are:

Latitude of the Well Reference Point (WRP) in the target 2D geographic CRS;
Longitude of the Well Reference Point in the target 2D geographic CRS;
dcf flag: 0 = no depth correction is applied; 2 = a variable depth correction factor along the path is applied;
n[]: Array of length num_points containing local northing coordinates, oriented to true north;
e[]: Array of length num_points containing local easting coordinates, oriented to true east;
D[]: Array of length num_points containing depths below the Vertical Reference Surface at survey stations down the wellbore (referred to as TVD in the SPE paper).

The output of LMP is ellipsoidal coordinates of the wellbore trajectory in a geographic 2D CRS. If required, projected coordinates of the wellbore may be calculated from these.

The following equations assume that the local coordinates (n,e) and depth D are in metres.  If these use a different unit of measure, then as a first step they should be converted to metres.

When dcf flag = 2, output arrays LAT, LON (in radians) are computed as:

	for i=1:num_points
		 = a (1 –  e^2) / (1 –  e^2 sin^2(LAT[i-1]))^3/2
		 = a / (1 –  e^2 sin^2(LAT[i-1]))^1/2
		LAT[i] = LAT[i-1] + (n[i] – n[i-1]) / ( – D[i]) 
		LON[i] = LON[i-1] + (e[i] – e[i-1]) / ( – D[i]) / cos(LAT[i-1])

where for i=1, for the first station: LAT[0] and LON[0] are the geographic coordinates of the WRP in radians; n[0] = 0, e[0] = 0.

and
	a is the semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid;
	e is the eccentricity of the reference ellipsoid (not to be confused with local easting);
	 is the radius of curvature in the meridian;
	 is the radius of curvature in the prime vertical.

When dcf flag = 0, the equations above are modified to:
		LAT[i] = LAT[i-1] + (n[i] – n[i-1]) /  
		LON[i] = LON[i-1] + (e[i] – e[i-1]) / { cos(LAT[i-1])}


Reverse case: 
To compute (n,e) from (LAT,LON,D):
	For i=1:num_points

		 = a / (1 –  e^2 sin^2(LAT[i-1]))^1/2
		n[i] = n[i-1] + (LAT[i] – LAT[i-1]) * ( – D[i])
		e[i] = e[i-1] + (LON[i] – LON[i-1]) * ( – D[i]) * cos(LAT[i-1])

where for the first station i=0 variables are initialised as in the forward case. Note that LAT[i-1], the latitude of the previous point, is used in the reverse formulas to compute the radii of curvature in order to be internally consistent in round trip calculations.

When dcf flag = 0, the equations above are modified to:
	n[i] = n[i-1] + (LAT[i] – LAT[i-1]) *  
	e[i] = e[i-1] + (LON[i] – LON[i-1]) *  * cos(LAT[i-1])","An example computation for the LMP method is provided below. This is not a realistic wellbore survey but demonstrates the computation steps.

The method has options for the application of two corrections:

i) point scale factor (psf) is used to scale horizontal offsets to the local scale for the projected CRS, resolved into east and north components (when a conformal map projection is used, psf_E = psf_N): (i) no psf correction is applied, (ii) the point scale factor at the well reference point is applied to the complete wellbore, and (iii) the point scale factor at each point along the wellbore is applied.

ii) depth correction factor (dcf) is used to scale horizontal offsets according to the depth of the point in the wellbore: (i) no dcf correction is applied, or (ii) a dcf correction is applied at each point along the wellbore. 

The inputs are:

WRP_E : Easting of the Well Reference Point in the target projected CRS;
WRP_N : Northing of the Well Reference Point in the target projected CRS;
psf flag :  0 for none; 1 for constant at first point; 2 to apply a variable point scale factor;
dcf flag : 0 for none; 2 to apply a variable depth correction factor along the path;
n[] : Array of length num_points containing local northing coordinates, oriented to Grid North of the target projected CRS;
e[] : Array of length num_points containing local easting coordinates, oriented to Grid East of the target projected CRS;
D[] : Array of length num_points containing depths below the Vertical Reference Surface at survey stations down the wellbore.

Care must be taken to convert local easting and northing to the same unit as used by the target projected CRS before applying the following equations.

If psf flag=0 and dcf flag=0 then the target coordinates are computed using a simple 2D translation:
	E = WRP_E + e
	N = WRP_N + n

If psf flag=1 and dcf flag=0 then the target coordinates are computed using a scaled offset as:
	E = WRP_E + e * psf_E
	N = WRP_N + n * psf_N

If psf flag=2 and dcf flag=2 then an iterative method is needed to compute the variable point scale factor and depth correction factor along the wellbore. The LMP method is recommended in this situation, but if the GNL method is used then map convergence should also be calculated variable along-hole to reference the local coordinates to grid north. 

Output arrays E and N of length num_points are computed as follows:
	For i=1:num_points
		for psf_E and psf_N, compute_psf(E[i-1], N[i-1])
                dcf = R / (R – D[i])
		E[i] = E[i-1] + (e[i] – e[i-1]) * psf_E * dcf 
		N[i] = N[i-1] + (n[i] – n[i-1]) * psf_N * dcf 

where for i=1, for the first station: E[0] = WRP_E; N[0] = WRP_N; e[0] = 0; n[0] = 0, and:
compute_psf() is a function that returns the local point scale factors in easting and northing directions at the given location;
R = 6371000 m. Note: Using a constant rather than the ellipsoidal local radii of curvature for the depth correction factors in easting and northing directions at the given location results in an insignificantly small error (e.g., for a lateral of 10 km at 10 km depth the worst case difference is 8 centimetres: 6371/(6371-10)=1.001572 vs. 6340/(6340-10)=1.001580).

This method allows the transformation of coordinates from one epoch (t1) to a second epoch (t2) through interpolation of the point's velocity from a grid. The velocity grid contains point velocities resolved into geocentric X, Y, and Z components. The interpolation CRS for the grid is a geographic 2D CRS.

First the latitude and longitude of the point are used to interpolate the three velocities vX, vY and vZ. Bi-linear interpolation is used. 

Then the ellipsoidal coordinates h of the point at epoch t1 are converted into geocentric Cartesian values XYZ at epoch t1 using the formula in §4.1.1.

Geocentric values at epoch t2 are then calculated using:
    X(t2) = X(t1) + (t2-t1) * vX
    Y(t2) = Y(t1) + (t2-t1) * vY
    Z(t2) = Z(t1) + (t2-t1) * vZ
ensuring that if the velocities are given in mm per year they are converted to metres per year.

Geographic 3D coordinates at epoch t2 are then calculated using the reverse formula in §4.1.1.

Reverse
In principle iteration is required to obtain the velocities at the target coordinates. In practice the secular velocity field changes very slowly with distance and the movement of a point for a change of epoch of a few years will usually not be enough to change the velocities. The second iteration will usually indicate that the solution has converged.

The procedure for each iteration is as for the forward calculation with the source epoch and target epoch transposed.","Given a point with geographic 3D coordinates lat = 0°00'00.0000""N, lon = 120°06'08.0000""E h = 61.000m referenced to SRGI2013 at epoch 2012.00 whose coordinates are required at epoch 2020.50:

9633,Ordnance Survey National Transformation,1,"This method is used for transformation between ETRS89 (or WGS 84) geographic and OSGB36 / National Grid projected coordinate reference systems.  It uses a gridded data set with nodes in a temporary projected CRS (ETRS89 / National Grid) for bi-linear interpolation of grid coordinate differences.

The offsets at a point are derived by interpolation within the gridded data. One grid file contains both easting and northing offsets. The grid file format is given in documentation available from the information source. The coordinate reference system for the coordinates of the grid fiule nodes is an intermediary projected CRS, ETRS89 / British National Grid.

For the transformation of ETRS89 coordinates to OSGB36 / British National Grid coordinates, the ETRS89 latitude and longitude are first converted into ETRS89 / National Grid values using the Transverse Mercator formulas given in EPSG method code 9807. Then bi-linear interpolation is used to derive easting and northing offset values. These are added to the temporary ETRS89 / National Grid coordinate values to give OSGB36 / National Grid coordinate values.

For the transformation of OSGB36 / British National Grid coordinates to ETRS89 latitude and longitude, iteration is required. For the first iteration the OSGB36 / British National Grid easting and northing values are assumed to be in the ETRS89 / National Grid. Bi-linear interpolation is used to derive the easting and northing offset values which are applied with sign reversed to the input coordinates.The result is used in further iterations of interpolation and application of offset until the difference between results from successive iterations is insignificant. Finally these Transverse Mercator grid coordinates are converted to ETRS89 latitude and longitude using the formulae given in EPSG method code 9807.",See information source.,Geodetic transformation between ETRS89 (or WGS 84) and OSGB36 / National Grid.

9658,Vertical Offset by Grid Interpolation (VERTCON),1,"The relationship between NGVD29 height and NAVD88 height vertical coordinate reference systems for the coterminous US is available through three gridded data files of offsets (sometimes called height differences). The vertical offset at a point is first interpolated within the grid of values using bi-linear interpolation. The interpolated offset is then applied as an offset:
•	If a NAVD88 height is desired when a NGVD29 height is given, add the interpolated offset to the NGVD29 height.
•	If a NGVD29 height is desired when a NAVD88 height is given, subtract the interpolated offset from the NAVD88 height.

Most horizontal positions of the bench marks used to generate the VERTCON grids were scaled from USGS topographic maps.  The estimated uncertainty of the scaled positions, 6 arc-seconds, is greater than the differences between NAD27 and NAD83 coordinates. Therefore the latitude and longitude used for interpolation of the grids can be referenced to either NAD27 or to NAD83(1986) or to any of the NAD83(NSRS) realisations (HARN, NSRS2007 or 2011).","For a point in the Conus central grid area at 29°28'00.443""N, 98°28'49.346""W (NAD83) with NGVD29 height of 247.47 meters (811.9 feet).

The P6 (I = J+90) seismic bin grid operation is a special case of the Affine Geometric Transformation (method code 9623). In practice bin grid definitions are based on an identified map grid. As such the example bin grids in the EPSG Dataset are described with the map grid (projected CRS) as source CRS. However to retain consistency with the syntax used in the description of the affine geometric transformation, in the formulas below the bin grid is the affine source CRS and the map grid is the affine target CRS.

XT0 ,YT0  = the map grid coordinates (easting, northing) of the origin point of the bin grid;

k = point scale factor of the map grid at a chosen reference point;
q  = the angle through which the bin grid axes must be rotated to coincide with the map grid axes (counter-clockwise is positive). Alternatively, the bearing (clockwise positive) of the bin grid J-axis measured relative to map grid north.","This example is given in the P6/98 document. The bin grid is based on projected CRS WGS 84 / UTM Zone 31N. The origin of the bin grid is defined to be at msp grid easting = 456781.0mE, northing = 5836723.0mN.  The map grid point scale factor at this point is 0.99984.

The bin width on the I-axis (XS axis) is 25 metres, whilst the bin width on the J-axis (YS axis) is 12.5 metres. At its origin the bin grid has bin values of 1,1.

In the map grid, the bearing of the bin grid I and J axes are 110° and 20° respectively. The latter is one of the transformation parameters.

The transformation parameter values are:

To derive the projected Easting and Northing coordinates of a point with geographical coordinates (lat,lon):

E = FE + r sin(theta)
N = FN + r0 - r cos(theta)
where
	mO = cos(latO)/(1 – e^2 sin^2(latO))^0.5 where latO is the latitude of natural origin
	tO = tan(pi/4 – latO/2)/[(1 – e sin(latO))/(1 + e sin(latO))]^e/2
	t = tan(pi/4 – lat/2)/[(1 – e sin(lat))/(1 + e sin(lat))]^e/2
	n = sin(latO)
	F = mO/(n tO^n)
	rO = a F tO^n kO  
	r =  a F t^n kO 
	theta = n(lon – lonO)
As with other conics, a negative n and r result for projections centered in the Southern Hemisphere.

The reverse formulas to derive the latitude and longitude of a point from its Easting and Northing values are:

lat = pi/2 - 2arctan{t'[(1 - e sin(lat))/(1 + e sin(lat))]^(e/2)}
lon = theta'/n +lon0
where
n, F, and rO are derived as for the forward calculation
r' = +/-[(E - FE)^2 + {r0 - (N - FN)}^2]^0.5  taking the sign of n
t' = (r'/(a k0 F))^(1/n)
If n is positive, theta' = atan2{(E –  FE) , [rO – (N –  FN)]}
but if n is negative the signs of both arguments of the atan2 function  must be reversed and theta' = atan2{– (E –  FE) , – [rO – (N –  FN)]}

Note that the formula for lat requires iteration. First calculate t' and then a trial value for lat using 
lat = /2-2atan(t'). Then use the full equation for lat substituting the trial value into the right hand side of the equation. Thus derive a new value for lat. Iterate the process until lat does not change significantly. The solution should quickly converge, in 3 or 4 iterations.","For Projected Coordinate System JAD69 / Jamaica National Grid

R is the radius of the sphere and will normally be one of the CRS parameters. If the figure of the earth used is an ellipsoid rather than a sphere then R should be calculated as the radius of the authalic sphere using the formula for RA given in EPSG Guidance Note 7-2, section 1.2, table 3.
