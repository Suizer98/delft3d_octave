% EXAMPLES
%
% A collection of example scripts for producing target and Taylor diagrams. 
%
% The diagrams produced by each script are in Portable Network Graphics
% (PNG) format and have the same file name as the script with a "png"
% suffix. Examples of the diagrams produced can be found in the same folder
% with the same file name as the script and ending in "_example.png". For
% example the diagram produced by target1.m is named target1_example.png.
