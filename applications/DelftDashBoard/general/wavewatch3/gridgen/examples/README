Example script to create a regional 10' grid for Alaska. Also provided is an script to 
modify the mask file when the regional grid is nested inside the global grid and only 
part of the regional grid is active (given by a polygon defined in alaska_10minzone.ascii). 

NOTE 1 : The path names at the top of the scripts will have to be changed to 
         the appropriate directories

NOTE 2:  The same script can be used to generate a global grid. The user will have to 
         define the grid ranges. For the global grid make sure that the IS_GLOBAL 
         parameter is set to 1 (this accounts for wrapping around in longitude). 

NOTE 3:  For building grids that cross the 0/360 meridian make the grids in two parts
         and then stitch them together. This is straightforward to do. 

NOTE 4:  Also provided are example longitude and lattitude arrays for a curvilinear grid 
         of the Arctic using a stereographic projection. For building this grid replace the
         lines detailing the development of 'lon' and 'lat' arrays in the template
         file by loading these files.
         load arctic_stereo_lat.dat ; lat = arctic_stereo_lat.dat;
         load arctic_stereo_lon.dat ; lon = arctic_stereo_lon.dat;
