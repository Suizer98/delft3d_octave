            Paragraph  "The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a global numerical weather prediction computer model run by NOAA. This mathematical model is run four times a day and produces forecasts up 16 days in advance, but with decreasing spatial and temporal resolution over time (it is widely accepted that beyond 7 days the forecast is little better than guesswork)."
            Paragraph  "The model is run in two parts: the first part has a higher resolution and goes out to 180 hours (7 days) in the future, the second part runs from 180 to 384 hours (16 days) at a lower resolution. The resolution of the model varies in each part of the model: horizontally, it divides the surface of the earth into 35 or 70 kilometre grid squares; vertically, it divides the atmosphere into 64 layers and temporally, it produces a forecast for every 3rd hour for the first 180 hours, after that they are produced for every 12th hour.<a href=""http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/modelinfo"">Read more.</a>"
