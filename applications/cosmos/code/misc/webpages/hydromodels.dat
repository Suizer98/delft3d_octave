            Image "models/delft3d.gif"
            Paragraph  "Delft3D is a world leading 2D/3D modelling system to investigate hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphology and water quality for fluvial, estuarine and coastal environments."
            Paragraph  "The software is used and has proven its capabilities in many places around the world, such as the Netherlands, USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Venice, etc. The software is continuously being improved and developed with innovative advanced modeling techniques as consequence of the research work of our institute.   <a href=""http://delftsoftware.wldelft.nl/"">Read more.</a>"

            Title "XBeach"
            Image "models/xbeach.jpg"
            Paragraph  "The XBeach model can be used as stand-alone model for small-scale (project-scale) coastal applications, but will also be used within the Morphos model system, where it will be driven by boundary conditions provided by the wind, wave and surge models and its main output to be transferred back will be the time-varying bathymetry and possibly discharges over breached barrier island sections. The model solves coupled 2D horizontal equations for wave propagation, flow, sediment transport and bottom changes, for varying (spectral) wave and flow boundary conditions. Because the model takes into account the variation in wave height in time (long known to surfers) it resolves the special long wave motions created by this variation. This so-called ‘surf beat’ is responsible for most of the swash waves that actually hit the dune front or overtop it. Because of this innovation the XBeach model is better able to model the development of the dune erosion profile and to predict when a dune or barrier island will start overwashing and breaching.<a href=""http://www.xbeach.org"">Read more.</a>"
