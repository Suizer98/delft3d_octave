            Title "Santa Barbara Operational Model System"
            Paragraph  "The Santa Barbara Model Prediction System has been set up as part of the USGS Southern California Coastal Hazards project. The system consists of several numerical models that generate forecasts of water levels, wave heights, coastal erosion and flooding for a period of up to 5 days in advance. The latest model predictions are posted on this website every 12 hours."
            Paragraph  "The system is still under development, and the model predictions have not yet been validated against field data. No decisions should therefore be made or actions undertaken on the basis of the data presented on this website."
