function varargout = reducepoints(varargin)
%REDUCEPOINTS Filters a set of points using a distance threshold.
%   I = REDUCEPOINTS(THRESH_DIST,X,Y,Z) returns an array I of indices of
%   points that form together a set of points that are mutually separated
%   by at least the specified distance THRESH_DIST. The Y and Z arguments
%   are optional, so the function works in 1 (X), 2 (X and Y) and 3 (X, Y
%   and Z) dimensions.
